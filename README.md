I am a transfer student at Old Dominion University (ODU) and am now working towards a B.S. in Computer Science. I have several years of experience working with software and technology and am looking forward to deepening my understanding of software development and engineering.

I also hold 2 x Associates degrees from Northern Virginia Community College

A.A. in Liberal Arts
A.A.S in Information Systems Technology

I am most familiar with programming in Java, but am looking forward to also studying C++ and Python here at ODU.

I am ineterested in video streaming technologies, as well as codecs and transport protocols  -  this relates to my work.

I am also just generally interested in technology and how systems can be improved and made more efficient.
